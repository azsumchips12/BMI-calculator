BMI Calculator

Description

This Python script calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms). It then classifies the BMI into different categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese.

How It Works

The script prompts the user to input their height in meters.

The user is then asked to input their weight in kilograms.

The BMI(height, weight) function calculates the BMI using the formula:



The function classifies the BMI into the following categories:

Severely Underweight: BMI < 16

Underweight: 16 <= BMI < 18.5

Normal: 18.5 <= BMI < 25

Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30

Obese Class I: 30 <= BMI < 35

Obese Class II: 35 <= BMI < 40

Obese Class III: BMI >= 40

The script prints the calculated BMI value and the corresponding category.

Example Usage

enter height in meters: 1.75
enter weight in kilograms: 68
your bmi is: 22.20408163265306 and you are: normal

Requirements

Python 3.x

How to Run

Save the script as bmi_calculator.py
